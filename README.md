# Project README Generator

## Description

User Story:
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

This application was created using node.js to generate professional README.md docs from the command line. The application uses inquirer through Node.js to create a series of prompts (name, title of application, application description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution, test instructions, license, GitHub handle, and email address). Once all prompts are answered, the application generates a professional README.md markdown file with the users inputs.
